                The long held idiom “reaching for the moon” was a dream realized as India’s Chandrayan 3 landed on the south pole of the lunar surface at 6.03 pm on August 23, 2023. Year 2023 will always be remembered for the remarkable achievement of India completing this space odyssey. Early 2024, ISRO could also successfully insert Aditya L1 solar observatory into Halo orbit around the sun-earth point L1.In fact, ISRO’s missions taught all of us how to aim for the stars believing in our own abilities and learning from failures. We are also proud of our DRDO scientists for Mission Divyastra, the first flight test of indigenously developed Agni-5 missile with Multiple Independently Targetable Re-entry Vehicle (MIRV) technology.

India’s space sector achievements emphasize the significance of core engineering fields and hope this will sow the seeds of change in mindset of engineering students to choose courses for their study accordingly. The celebration of the Chandrayan Mahotsav on 4th September by our first year students inspired them to think in this direction.

Year 2023-24 marked many major achievements for our institution also. VESIT was conferred “Autonomous Status” by UGC for a period of 10 years. We were also privileged to be amongst the first few Higher Education Institutions to implement the New National Education Policy – 2020 in Maharashtra state. VESIT has been also rated AAA+, by CAREERS 360 in India’s Best Engineering Institutions Survey 2023. Education World Pvt. Ltd. has ranked our institute as Second Best Private Engineering Institute in Maharashtra State.

In this special year, we are proud to get representation in the Republic Day Parade at Kartavya Path (Rajpath), India Gate, New Delhi. We are really proud of our students Shrawani Pawaskar and Dnyanesh Avhad for getting selected for participation in Vande Bharatam Classical Dance Presentation and as Best NCC Cadet representing Mumbai B group respectively in the Republic Day Parade 2024.

We are proud of our student teams who have secured 1st prize in Smart India Hackathon and Three winner teams in 18th Aavishkar University Research Convention, getting an opportunity to represent Mumbai University.

Our faculty team Dr.Nilima Warke and Dr.Jayamala Adsul received Grant-in-Aid of Rs 82.59 Lakhs from Ministry of Electronics and information Technology (MeitY), Govt. of India for the Academia-Industry Collaborative project “Development of ASICs or SoCs for programmable gain amplifier and reconfigurable ADCs for wide range of applications” under “Chips to Startup (C2S) Category - I. The aim of the Chips to Startup (C2S) program is to build a vibrant semiconductor design and innovation ecosystem aimed at developing Specialized Manpower in VLSI/Embedded System Design. We are delighted to inform you that VESIT is the only private educational institute from Maharashtra which has been selected under category-I. Along with this grant money, the institute has been granted remote access to development tools worth more than Rs. 1 crore. This project is an extension of the Ph.D. (Mumbai University) work undertaken by Dr. Nilima Warke and Dr. Jayamala

Adsul, under the mentorship of Dr. P. P. Vaidya, Emeritus Prof. and Hon. Dean R&D and will be implemented in collaboration with Shri. Amit Rambhia, Chairman and Managing Director of Panache Digilife Ltd., a distinguished alumni of VESIT.

I am very much delighted to add that our institute has also been granted Rs. 38.31 lakhs for a duration of 60 months for implementation of “Visvesvaraya PhD Scheme” for Electronics at our research centre. The research candidate enrolled for the Ph.D, under this scheme will receive monthly fellowship from this grant.
